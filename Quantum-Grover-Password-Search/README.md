# Grover’s Algorithm – Quantum Password Search ⚛️

## Overview
This project demonstrates Grover’s Search Algorithm, which provides
a quadratic speedup over classical brute-force search.

A hidden “password” is encoded as a target quantum state, and Grover’s
algorithm is used to find it efficiently.

## Concepts Used
- Grover’s Algorithm
- Oracle construction
- Amplitude amplification
- Quantum measurement

## Technologies
- Python 3.11
- Qiskit
- Qiskit Aer

## Outcome
The algorithm successfully identifies the target state with high probability
using fewer iterations than classical search.
