# Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) ⚛️

## Overview
This project demonstrates the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) using Qiskit.  
QFT is the quantum analogue of the classical Discrete Fourier Transform and is a fundamental component in many quantum algorithms such as Shor’s algorithm and phase estimation.

## Concepts Used
- Quantum superposition
- Phase rotation gates
- Quantum interference
- Quantum Fourier Transform

## How It Works
1. A quantum state is prepared (example: |101⟩).
2. The Quantum Fourier Transform circuit is applied.
3. The transformed quantum state is measured.
4. The output probabilities are visualized.

## Technologies
- Python 3.11
- Qiskit
- Qiskit Aer
- Matplotlib

## Outcome
The program demonstrates how QFT transforms a quantum state into a different probability distribution representing phase information.

## Future Improvements
- Implement QFT manually using Hadamard and controlled phase gates
- Visualize circuit diagram
- Demonstrate inverse QFT
- Connect QFT to phase estimation
