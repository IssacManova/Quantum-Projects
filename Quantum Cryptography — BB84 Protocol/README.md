# BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol 🔐⚛️

## Overview
This project simulates the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol, which allows
two parties to securely share a secret key using quantum mechanics.

Any eavesdropping attempt introduces detectable errors due to quantum measurement.

## Concepts Used
- Quantum superposition
- Quantum measurement
- No-cloning theorem
- Quantum cryptography

## Technologies
- Python 3.11
- Qiskit
- Qiskit Aer

## Outcome
The protocol successfully generates a shared secret key and detects the presence
of an eavesdropper through increased error rates.
