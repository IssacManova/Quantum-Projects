# Quantum Teleportation ⚛️

## Overview
This project demonstrates quantum teleportation, where the quantum state
of one qubit is transmitted to another qubit using entanglement and classical communication.

## Concepts Used
- Quantum entanglement
- Bell states
- Quantum measurement
- Classical communication

## Technologies
- Python
- Qiskit
- Qiskit Aer

## Outcome
The state of one qubit is successfully transferred to another qubit without physically moving it.
